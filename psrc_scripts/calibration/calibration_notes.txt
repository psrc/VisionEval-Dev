# Calibration steps
- Change variables in these scripts:
    - CalculateVehicleTrips.R
    - CalculateHouseholdDvmt.R
    - CalcualteAltModeTrips.R

See previous commits to note the exact locations of scaling factors

Once changes are made, build a clean version
- open the R project (C:\Workspace\visioneval-dev\VisionEval-dev.Rproj) in R studio that is running with admin rights!
     - if there is a simple exit error, this is likely the reason.
- setwd("C:/Workspace/visioneval-dev")
- first, clean with ve.build(c("clean"))
- then, ve.build() (should take 30-60 min)

There will be a "built" folder now available. 

- Copy "defs" and "inputs" from psrc_scripts folder in this repo, to built/visioneval/4.1.2/runtime/models/VERSPM
- Open the file "run_model.R" in RStudio.
- setwd to location of the newly built model 
    - setwd("C:/Workspace/visioneval-dev/built/visioneval/4.1.2/runtime/models/VERSPM")
- Select all code from run_model.R and execute
- Run validation.ipynb to check results and adjust calibration factors
