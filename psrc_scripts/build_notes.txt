See instructions in Building.md

One issue is that RStudio needs to be run in admin mode to ensure a build

To add in PSRC survey data, we need to build from scratch after copying in the survey Rda files
The survey Rda files are generated from the scripts here. 
Copy them to C:\Workspace\VisionEval_build\VisionEval\built\visioneval\4.1.2\src\VE2001NHTS\data-raw

# In this *built* version, copy in the data to data-raw
Then run Make2011NHTSDataset.r to create other tables that go in the data table


I'm not sure this will actually re-estimate the models though. It might need to be totally re-built!
In order to create estimation datasets, use ve.build(express=FALSE)

------------
Other notes

- use ve.build(c('clean'))  to start from scratch with new data
